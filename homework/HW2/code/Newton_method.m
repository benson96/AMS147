%Inputs:
% fun: function handle representing f(x) 
% tol: maximum tolerance allowed for the increment |x^(k+1) ? x^(k)|
% Nmax: maximum number of iterations allowed 
% dfun: function handle representing df(x)/dx 
% x0: initial guess for the zero 

%Outputs:
% z0: approximation of the zero z0 
% iter: number of iterations to obtain z0
% res: residual at z0 (i.e., |f(z0)|) 
% his: vector collecting all the elements of the sequence {x(k)}k=0,1,....
